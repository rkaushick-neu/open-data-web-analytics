### Datasets Over Time
![Dataset sessions over time (2023 vs 2024)](./screenshots/Top_10_Dataset_Sessions_Over_Time.png)

| Month     | 2023_Sessions | 2024_Sessions | Percentage_Change |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| January   | 15,076        | 22,476        | + 49.08%          |
| February  | 15,457        | 18,636        | + 20.57%          |
| March     | 22,192        | 24,226        | + 9.17%           |
| April     | 15,104        | 32,304        | + 113.88%         |
| May       | 12,535        | 16,178        | + 29.06%          |
| June      | 16,546        | 16,880        | + 2.02%           |
| July      | 14,298        | 15,215        | + 6.41%           |
| August    | 12,341        | 12,366        | + 0.2%            |
| September | 17,474        | 25,738        | + 47.29%          |
| October   | 21,000        | 23,995        | + 14.26%          |
| November  | 22,981        | 28,418        | + 23.66%          |
| December  | 13,075        | 14,120        | + 7.99%           |

From the graph and table above, we can see that in 2024, the City of Toronto’s Open Data portal saw a consistent increase in dataset session activity compared to 2023, with the most significant spike in April. This spike in April corresponds perfectly with the dogs-issued-dangerous-dog-orders dataset as shown [here](#monthly-engagement-with-top-dataset-pages-2024). Overall, monthly sessions in 2024 outperformed those in 2023 across nearly all months, indicating improved engagement with the portal.

### Top Datasets by Sessions of All Time (2023 & 2024)
![Bar plot containing the dataset with the highest sessions](./screenshots/Top_10_Dataset_Sessions.png)

<br>
When looking at total sessions across 2023 and 2024, the Short-Term Rentals Registration dataset led the way with 18,860 sessions, just slightly ahead of Dogs Issued Dangerous Dog Orders at 18,389 sessions.
Neighbourhood Profiles and 3D Massing datasets followed closely, reflecting continued user engagement with local community and development-related information.
Datasets related to Healthcare Outbreaks, Shelter Activities, and Traffic Volumes also saw strong and consistent interest, showing that users are actively engaging with public health, social services, and transportation data.

### Top Downloaded Datasets (2024)
![Top 10 Downloaded Datasets in 2024](./screenshots/Top_10_Dataset_Downloads_2024.png)

<br>
Even in 2024, just like in 2023, there was a large gap between the total number of sessions vs the total number of downloads. Many people viewed the datasets but fewer downloaded them. This is especially true in the dangerous dog-orders dataset which had around 15,000 sessions but less than 4,000 downloads. Short-Term Rentals had steady engagement across both metrics.

### Weekly Engagement with Popular Datasets (2024)
![Weekly Engagement with Popular Datasets (2024)](./screenshots/Weekly%20Engagement%20with%20Popular%20Datasets%20(2024).png)

<br>
This chart shows how users engaged with key datasets throughout the week in 2024. The dogs-issued-dangerous-dog-orders dataset clearly stood out, spiking dramatically midweek with 6.1K sessions on Wednesday and 5.7K sessions on Thursday, before declining sharply into the weekend. This midweek surge suggests the dataset attracted attention during working days, likely tied to city council discussions or public safety campaigns.
Other datasets like neighbourhood profiles, short-term rentals registration, and outbreaks in Toronto healthcare institutions showed steadier patterns, peaking slightly around midweek and decreasing during Saturdays and Sundays.
As with previous years, the overall trend reveals that dataset exploration is highest during weekdays, reinforcing the role of open data in supporting professional, academic, and civic research during the traditional workweek.

### Monthly Engagement with Top Dataset Pages (2024)
![Monthly Engagement with Top Dataset Pages (2024)](./screenshots/Monthly%20Engagement%20with%20Top%20Dataset%20Pages%20(2024).png)

<br>
In 2024, the dogs-issued-dangerous-dog-orders dataset saw a dramatic spike in April, reaching 15,000 sessions—by far the highest single-month dataset traffic of the year. This surge likely coincides with heightened public attention or a city council debate around pet safety regulations. 
<br>

The dots were further connected when looking at the refferer domains, i.e. the websites where people came from to visit the Open Data portal, [here](#monthly-sessions-by-referring-category-2024). 

<br>
Following the peak, engagement with that dataset dropped sharply, while overall interest in other datasets remained more stable. The short-term rentals registration dataset peaked in September with 1,800 sessions, reflecting seasonal housing interest or regulatory changes.
Datasets like neighbourhood profiles, outbreaks in Toronto healthcare institutions, and 3D massing maintained consistent but modest engagement across the year, each contributing to steady ongoing public exploration of local data.
This chart underscores how public discourse and civic events can sharply drive demand for specific datasets—sometimes turning niche topics into high-traffic content.

### Monthly Sessions by Referring Category (2024)
![Monthly Sessions by Referring Category (2024)](./screenshots/Monthly%20Sessions%20by%20Referring%20Category%20(2024).png)

<br>
In 2024, Government and Public Services Sites once again led as the primary driver of traffic to the Open Data Portal, with a major surge in April reaching over 20K sessions—the highest monthly spike of the year. 

Let's taka a deeper look into these two months.

April '24: <br>
Several news articles (light blue line in the above graph) relating to dog attacks in Toronto such as this one from [CTV News](https://www.ctvnews.ca/toronto/article/officials-to-visit-all-dangerous-dog-owners-in-toronto-as-new-compliance-measures-go-in-effect/) brought in lots of people to the Open Data Potal. There was also an article at the same time in the [Toronto City website](https://www.toronto.ca/news/city-of-toronto-taking-actions-to-address-dangerous-dog-behaviour/) which links to the Dangerous Dog Orders dataset which clearly brought in extra traffic. 


Other categories such as Search Engines, and Uncategorized referrers remained consistently lower but showed subtle increases toward the end of the year, particularly in October and November.
This data reflects the continued importance of official and city-affiliated platforms in driving engagement with open data.

### Top 10 Owner Divisions by Views (2024)
![Overall Top 10 Owner Divisions by Views (2024)](./screenshots/Top_10_Owner_Division_Views_2024.png)
<br>

The standout event was an explosive spike in April for Municipal Licensing & Standards, with over 21,000 views, potentially linked to permit cycles or regulatory changes.

<br>

Viewership patterns in 2024 were more volatile, with higher highs but sharper drops between months compared to 2023. 'Planning' and 'Information & Technology' saw moderate, steady attention, while Transportation Services had stable mid-level activity across the year. Social Development held a consistent presence, peaking in March and November <br>

## Analysis of Real World Events

### Elections

#### Search Term Views Over Time (2023)
![Top 5 Search Terms Over Time in 2023](./screenshots/Top_5_Search_Terms_2023.png)
<br>

In 2023, search activity for "elections" showed a dramatic spike in June which is likely related to Toronto's Mayoral By-Election on June 26, 2023. 
Here is the [Statement from Toronto City Clerk's Office](https://www.toronto.ca/news/statement-from-toronto-city-clerk/).

#### Search Term Views Over Time (2024)
![Top 5 Search Terms Over Time in 2024](./screenshots/Top_5_Search_Terms_2024.png)

As discussed previously, user interest was more evenly distributed across top terms like TTC and housing. Interestingly elections also saw noticeable peaks in June and November '24. However, these were significantly lesser searches comapred to 2023. The likely reason behind interest in election in June was likely due to the [Federal By-Election in the electoral district of Toronto-St. Paul](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2024/05/19/prime-minister-announces-election-toronto-st-pauls) on June 24, 2024. In November again there were the [Toronto Muncipal By-Elections for Don Valley West](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/9727-Declaration-of-Results-for-the-Councillor-Ward-15-ByElectionfor-posting.pdf) on November 4, 2024, which likely resulted in the second spike.

### Civic Issues

### Distribution of Civic Issues by Views (2024)
![Civic Issues by Views in 2024](./screenshots/Civic_Issues_Donut_2024.png)

#### Comparing Distribution of Civic Issues in 2023 & 2024

|         Civic Issues | 2023 Views | 2024 Views | Percent Change |
|----------------------|------------|------------|----------------|
|             Mobility |     22,163 |     25,175 |       + 13.59% |
|    Poverty reduction |     11,973 |     13,166 |        + 9.96% |
|   Affordable housing |      9,197 |      9,977 |        + 8.48% |
|       Climate change |      6,107 |      7,320 |       + 19.86% |
|Fiscal responsibility |      3,884 |      4,628 |       + 19.16% |

Further based on the metadata of the datasets, we can see which dataset is associated with which specific civic issue. From the above graphs, and table we can see that mobility remains the dominant concern, reflecting ongoing focus on transit and road infrastructure. Poverty civic issue has a similar number of views in both years.

| transportation                 | 829       | 1.68%     |
| neighbourhood                  | 744       | 1.51%     |
| boundary                       | 717       | 1.45%     |
| former municipality boundaries | 713       | 1.44%     |
| street tree data               | 632       | 1.28%     |

<br>
In 2024, the search behavior shifted toward more transport, infrastructure and planning-related topics, with "TTC" followed by "housing", and "traffic".

### Trends in File Download Activity (2023–2024)
![Trends in File Download Activity (2023–2024)](./screenshots/Trends%20in%20File%20Download%20Activity%20(2023–2024).png)

<br>
This area chart shows how file download activity on the Open Data Portal evolved from early 2023 through the end of 2024. Downloads started relatively steady in early 2023, with a slight dip midyear, but momentum picked up sharply toward the end of 2023—growing from 910 clicks in July 2023 to 1,520 clicks by October 2023.
This upward trend continued into 2024, with significant growth through the spring and a major spike in October 2024 reaching 3,734 downloads—the highest point across the two years. After this peak, downloads tapered off slightly but remained well above early 2023 levels.
The steady rise suggests increasing public interest and trust in the portal’s datasets, possibly fueled by expanded data offerings, enhanced visibility efforts, or major civic initiatives that drove people to actively download and use open data resources.
